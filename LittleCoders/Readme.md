# Term-I Little Coders
Little Coders is an engaging and playful introduction to the world of coding designed specifically for young learners. Using Scratch Jr., a simplified, block-based visual programming platform, this course introduces foundational computational thinking concepts like sequencing, loops, and events in a fun, interactive way. Through colorful characters, animations, and storytelling, children learn to create their own interactive stories, games, and animations by dragging and connecting blocks that represent actions and commands. The curriculum focuses on hands-on activities that encourage creativity, problem-solving, and logical thinking while aligning with the developmental needs of kindergarten students. Each session includes guided projects, such as making a character dance or creating a simple story with movement and sound, fostering collaboration and communication skills. By integrating Scratch programming into the "Little Coders" course, Term-I lays the groundwork for early STEM education, helping children develop critical 21st-century skills in an age-appropriate and enjoyable manner. With teacher support and a focus on exploration, this course inspires curiosity and confidence in young learners, setting them on a path to becoming future innovators.

## Assessment Plan for Term-0 Tiny Stars

**Objective:** 

The assessment plan for **Term-I Little Coders** is designed to evaluate students’ understanding of foundational STEM concepts, creativity, teamwork, and problem-solving skills in a playful and age-appropriate manner. The focus is on formative assessment through observation, participation, and project-based evaluation, ensuring that learning remains engaging and stress-free for young learners.



### 1. Assessment Goals
- Evaluate students’ grasp of basic STEM concepts (e.g., sequencing, patterns, loops, events).  
- Assess creativity and ability to apply learned concepts in hands-on activities.  
- Measure collaboration and communication skills during group projects.  
- Track progress in problem-solving, logical thinking, and critical reasoning.  
- Celebrate individual and group achievements to build confidence and motivation.



### 2. Assessment Methods

#### A. Formative Assessments (Ongoing Evaluation)  
Formative assessments are integrated into daily lessons and activities to monitor progress and provide feedback throughout the term.  

1. **Daily Exercises**  
   - Students complete short tasks at the end of each lesson (e.g., drawing patterns, building sequences, or describing their work).  
   - Teachers review these exercises to identify areas where additional support may be needed.  

2. **Teacher Observations**  
   - Observe students during hands-on activities, group work, and discussions.  
   - Look for evidence of engagement, participation, and application of concepts.  
   - Document observations using a simple checklist or rubric (e.g., "Student demonstrates understanding of loops").  

3. **Peer Feedback**  
   - Encourage students to give positive feedback to peers during group activities (e.g., "What did you like about your teammate’s idea?").  
   - This fosters a collaborative environment and helps students reflect on their own work.  

4. **Weekly Reflections**  
   - At the end of each week, ask students to share one thing they learned or enjoyed.  
   - Use prompts like:  
     - "What was your favorite activity this week?"  
     - "How did you help your team today?"  



#### B. Summative Assessments (End-of-Term Evaluation)  
Summative assessments evaluate overall learning outcomes at the end of the term through final projects and presentations.  

1. **Final Project Evaluation**  
   - Each group’s final project (Week 12) serves as the primary summative assessment.  
   - Use a rubric to assess:  
     - **Creativity:** Did students use imaginative ideas and unique designs?  
     - **Concept Application:** Were STEM concepts (e.g., sequencing, loops, events) applied effectively?  
     - **Teamwork:** Did students collaborate well and contribute equally?  
     - **Presentation Skills:** Was the project presented clearly and confidently?  

   **Sample Rubric for Final Project:**  

   | Criteria               | Excellent (5)                          | Good (3–4)                              | Needs Improvement (1–2)                 |  
   |------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|  
   | Creativity             | Highly original and detailed.          | Some originality but could improve detail. | Lacks originality or effort.            |  
   | Concept Application    | All concepts applied correctly.        | Most concepts applied correctly.        | Few concepts applied correctly.         |  
   | Teamwork               | Strong collaboration; all members contributed. | Moderate collaboration; some members contributed. | Limited collaboration; uneven contributions. |  
   | Presentation           | Clear, confident, and engaging.        | Somewhat clear but needs improvement.   | Unclear or disorganized.                |  

2. **Individual Contributions**  
   - Assess each student’s role in the final project based on teacher observations and peer feedback.  
   - Ensure recognition of individual strengths (e.g., leadership, creativity, technical skills).  

3. **Parent/Teacher Feedback**  
   - Invite parents to observe the final showcase and provide feedback on their child’s growth.  
   - Teachers summarize observations and provide written feedback highlighting strengths and areas for improvement.  



### 3. Assessment Tools
- **Checklists:** For tracking participation, understanding, and skill development during activities.  
- **Rubrics:** For evaluating final projects and presentations.  
- **Portfolios:** Collect students’ daily exercises, drawings, and reflections to document progress over time.  
- **Certificates:** Award certificates for specific achievements (e.g., "Best Problem Solver," "Creative Thinker") to celebrate individual and group efforts.  



### 4. Reporting and Celebration
1. **Progress Reports**  
   - Provide informal progress reports midway through the term to update parents on their child’s development.  
   - Include strengths, areas for improvement, and suggestions for home practice.  

2. **Final Showcase**  
   - Host a celebratory showcase event where students present their final projects to parents, teachers, and peers.  
   - Highlight achievements through awards, certificates, and verbal praise.  

3. **Feedback Loop**  
   - Gather feedback from parents and students about the program to inform future iterations of Term-0 Tiny Stars.  



### 5. Key Principles of Assessment
- **Play-Based Learning:** Assessments are embedded in playful, hands-on activities to ensure they remain enjoyable for young learners.  
- **Developmentally Appropriate:** Focus on effort, creativity, and growth rather than perfection or competition.  
- **Holistic Approach:** Evaluate not only technical skills but also soft skills like teamwork, communication, and confidence.  
- **Positive Reinforcement:** Emphasize encouragement and celebration to build a love for learning and exploration.  



### 6. Sample Timeline for Assessment

| Week       | Assessment Activity                              | Method Used                  |  
|------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|  
| Weeks 1–11 | Daily exercises, teacher observations, checklists | Formative assessment         |  
| Week 6     | Midterm reflection and informal progress report  | Teacher feedback to parents  |  
| Week 12    | Final project evaluation and showcase            | Summative assessment         |  



### Conclusion

By blending structured skill-building with playful exploration, this assessment plan ensures learners not only grasp coding fundamentals but also develop a lifelong love for creative problem-solving. The journey from Lesson 1 (Meet Scratch Cat) to Lesson 36 (Coding Certificate) empowers them to think, create, and share with confidence!
