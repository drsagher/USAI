# Term-I Little Coders
Little Coders is an engaging and playful introduction to the world of coding designed specifically for young learners. Using Scratch Jr., a simplified, block-based visual programming platform, this course introduces foundational computational thinking concepts like sequencing, loops, and events in a fun, interactive way. Through colorful characters, animations, and storytelling, children learn to create their own interactive stories, games, and animations by dragging and connecting blocks that represent actions and commands. The curriculum focuses on hands-on activities that encourage creativity, problem-solving, and logical thinking while aligning with the developmental needs of kindergarten students. Each session includes guided projects, such as making a character dance or creating a simple story with movement and sound, fostering collaboration and communication skills. By integrating Scratch programming into the "Little Coders" course, Term-I lays the groundwork for early STEM education, helping children develop critical 21st-century skills in an age-appropriate and enjoyable manner. With teacher support and a focus on exploration, this course inspires curiosity and confidence in young learners, setting them on a path to becoming future innovators.
