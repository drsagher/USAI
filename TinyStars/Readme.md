## Assessment Plan for Term-0 Tiny Stars

**Objective:** 

The assessment plan for *Term-0 Tiny Stars* is designed to evaluate students’ understanding of foundational STEM concepts, creativity, teamwork, and problem-solving skills in a playful and age-appropriate manner. The focus is on formative assessment through observation, participation, and project-based evaluation, ensuring that learning remains engaging and stress-free for young learners.



### 1. Assessment Goals
- Evaluate students’ grasp of basic STEM concepts (e.g., sequencing, patterns, loops, events).  
- Assess creativity and ability to apply learned concepts in hands-on activities.  
- Measure collaboration and communication skills during group projects.  
- Track progress in problem-solving, logical thinking, and critical reasoning.  
- Celebrate individual and group achievements to build confidence and motivation.



### 2. Assessment Methods

#### A. Formative Assessments (Ongoing Evaluation)  
Formative assessments are integrated into daily lessons and activities to monitor progress and provide feedback throughout the term.  

1. **Daily Exercises**  
   - Students complete short tasks at the end of each lesson (e.g., drawing patterns, building sequences, or describing their work).  
   - Teachers review these exercises to identify areas where additional support may be needed.  

2. **Teacher Observations**  
   - Observe students during hands-on activities, group work, and discussions.  
   - Look for evidence of engagement, participation, and application of concepts.  
   - Document observations using a simple checklist or rubric (e.g., "Student demonstrates understanding of loops").  

3. **Peer Feedback**  
   - Encourage students to give positive feedback to peers during group activities (e.g., "What did you like about your teammate’s idea?").  
   - This fosters a collaborative environment and helps students reflect on their own work.  

4. **Weekly Reflections**  
   - At the end of each week, ask students to share one thing they learned or enjoyed.  
   - Use prompts like:  
     - "What was your favorite activity this week?"  
     - "How did you help your team today?"  



#### B. Summative Assessments (End-of-Term Evaluation)  
Summative assessments evaluate overall learning outcomes at the end of the term through final projects and presentations.  

1. **Final Project Evaluation**  
   - Each group’s final project (Week 12) serves as the primary summative assessment.  
   - Use a rubric to assess:  
     - **Creativity:** Did students use imaginative ideas and unique designs?  
     - **Concept Application:** Were STEM concepts (e.g., sequencing, loops, events) applied effectively?  
     - **Teamwork:** Did students collaborate well and contribute equally?  
     - **Presentation Skills:** Was the project presented clearly and confidently?  

   **Sample Rubric for Final Project:**  

   | Criteria               | Excellent (5)                          | Good (3–4)                              | Needs Improvement (1–2)                 |  
   |------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|  
   | Creativity             | Highly original and detailed.          | Some originality but could improve detail. | Lacks originality or effort.            |  
   | Concept Application    | All concepts applied correctly.        | Most concepts applied correctly.        | Few concepts applied correctly.         |  
   | Teamwork               | Strong collaboration; all members contributed. | Moderate collaboration; some members contributed. | Limited collaboration; uneven contributions. |  
   | Presentation           | Clear, confident, and engaging.        | Somewhat clear but needs improvement.   | Unclear or disorganized.                |  

2. **Individual Contributions**  
   - Assess each student’s role in the final project based on teacher observations and peer feedback.  
   - Ensure recognition of individual strengths (e.g., leadership, creativity, technical skills).  

3. **Parent/Teacher Feedback**  
   - Invite parents to observe the final showcase and provide feedback on their child’s growth.  
   - Teachers summarize observations and provide written feedback highlighting strengths and areas for improvement.  



### 3. Assessment Tools
- **Checklists:** For tracking participation, understanding, and skill development during activities.  
- **Rubrics:** For evaluating final projects and presentations.  
- **Portfolios:** Collect students’ daily exercises, drawings, and reflections to document progress over time.  
- **Certificates:** Award certificates for specific achievements (e.g., "Best Problem Solver," "Creative Thinker") to celebrate individual and group efforts.  



### 4. Reporting and Celebration
1. **Progress Reports**  
   - Provide informal progress reports midway through the term to update parents on their child’s development.  
   - Include strengths, areas for improvement, and suggestions for home practice.  

2. **Final Showcase**  
   - Host a celebratory showcase event where students present their final projects to parents, teachers, and peers.  
   - Highlight achievements through awards, certificates, and verbal praise.  

3. **Feedback Loop**  
   - Gather feedback from parents and students about the program to inform future iterations of Term-0 Tiny Stars.  



### 5. Key Principles of Assessment
- **Play-Based Learning:** Assessments are embedded in playful, hands-on activities to ensure they remain enjoyable for young learners.  
- **Developmentally Appropriate:** Focus on effort, creativity, and growth rather than perfection or competition.  
- **Holistic Approach:** Evaluate not only technical skills but also soft skills like teamwork, communication, and confidence.  
- **Positive Reinforcement:** Emphasize encouragement and celebration to build a love for learning and exploration.  



### 6. Sample Timeline for Assessment

| Week       | Assessment Activity                              | Method Used                  |  
|------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|  
| Weeks 1–11 | Daily exercises, teacher observations, checklists | Formative assessment         |  
| Week 6     | Midterm reflection and informal progress report  | Teacher feedback to parents  |  
| Week 12    | Final project evaluation and showcase            | Summative assessment         |  



### Conclusion
The *Term-0 Tiny Stars* assessment plan ensures that students’ progress is evaluated in a supportive, engaging, and meaningful way. By combining formative and summative assessments with a focus on creativity, teamwork, and STEM skills, the program lays a strong foundation for future learning while celebrating each child’s unique contributions and growth.
