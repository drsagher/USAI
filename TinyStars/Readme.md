# Term-0 TinyStars
Term-0 TinyStars for Kindergarten (K.G.) serves as the foundational eligibility criterion for admission into the prestigious Kindergarten (K.G.) STEM Entrepreneurs Class, designed to nurture young minds with a passion for innovation and creativity. This 12-week program spans 36 lessons, with three engaging lessons per week, carefully crafted to introduce children to the basics of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) concepts through playful, hands-on activities. The curriculum emphasizes critical skills such as problem-solving, logical thinking, collaboration, and creativity, using age-appropriate tools like block-based coding, simple robotics, storytelling, and interactive experiments. Each lesson is designed to spark curiosity and build confidence, ensuring that children not only enjoy the learning process but also develop a strong foundation for future academic success. By the end of Term-0, students are assessed on their ability to follow instructions, demonstrate basic computational thinking, and exhibit enthusiasm for discovery, which determines their readiness for the advanced STEM Entrepreneurs Class. Through this structured yet flexible program, TinyStars empowers young learners to become confident, curious, and capable thinkers, setting them on the path to becoming tomorrow’s innovators and leaders
